# Product Guidelines

## Prose Style
- **Concise and Technical:** All user-facing text, tooltips, and documentation should be brief, precise, and efficient. Use clear technical terminology to provide clarity and maintain a tool-like professional feel.

## Brand Identity
- **Naming:** The project should be referred to as **YTDL-Go** in all formal text and branding to emphasize the core functionality while acknowledging its technical foundation in Go.

## Visual Identity & UI Design
- **Vibrant and Dynamic:** The interface should utilize color and fluid animations to provide active feedback and create a modern, engaging atmosphere.
- **Dynamic Feedback:** Use subtle visual cues and transitions to guide the user's eye and indicate state changes (e.g., download start, completion, or error states).

## Error Handling & Feedback
- **Action-Oriented Messages:** Error messages must briefly describe the issue and prioritize providing a clear, immediate solution or the most logical next step to resolve the problem.
- **Proactive Assistance:** Where possible, the UI should guide the user away from potential errors before they occur.

## Loading & Processing States
- **Determinate Progress:** As a performance-focused tool, YTDL-Go must prioritize providing accurate, determinate progress bars (percentage-based) whenever the information is available, ensuring users have clear expectations of processing times.
