# Frontend Maintainers

This document defines maintainer responsibilities for the web UI in `frontend/`.
For project-wide maintainer ownership, see `docs/MAINTAINERS.md`.

## Current Frontend Maintainer(s)

- `@lvcoi` - project lead and frontend/backend integration owner

## Responsibilities

Frontend maintainers are responsible for:

- Reviewing pull requests that modify `frontend/`.
- Keeping frontend dependencies current and secure.
- Preserving UI behavior and interaction consistency.
- Verifying frontend output integrates correctly with embedded web assets.

## Ownership Boundaries

- Frontend maintainers own `frontend/src/`, `frontend/docs/`, and build config in `frontend/`.
- API contract changes are coordinated with backend maintainers before merge.

## Becoming a Frontend Maintainer

Active contributors with repeated high-quality frontend contributions may be invited to join maintenance responsibilities.
