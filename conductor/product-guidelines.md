# Prose Style
- **Friendly and Modern:** We use an approachable, helpful tone that guides the user through complex tasks while maintaining a high standard of professional technical accuracy. Documentation and UI copy should feel premium yet accessible.

# Visual Identity
- **Premium Glassmorphism:** The Web UI leverages "frosted glass" effects (backdrop-blur), subtle borders, and refined typography to create a sophisticated, high-end feel that distinguishes ytdl-go as a modern application.
- **Content-Centric Dark Mode:** A sleek, dark aesthetic is the standard. This approach minimizes interface distractions, ensuring that media thumbnails, metadata, and progress indicators remain the primary focus of the user's attention.

# User Communication
- **Visual and Progressive Disclosure:** Status information is communicated primarily through clear visual indicators (icons, state-aware colors, and smooth progress bars). Detailed technical logs and diagnostic data are available but remain tucked away behind "Advanced" or "Details" toggles to maintain a clean default experience.

# Brand Messaging
- **Engineered for Speed:** We highlight the choice of Go as our foundation, emphasizing technical superiority and the efficiency gains it provides over traditional Python-based tools.
- **Modern Reliability:** We position ytdl-go as a robust and stable anchor in the media download ecosystem, focusing on resilience against platform changes and a commitment to maintainable code.
