# Initial Concept
A powerful, blazing fast YouTube downloader written in Go with a focus on high-performance parallel downloads and a modern web interface.

# Product Definition

## Target Audience
The primary audience for ytdl-go consists of general users who seek a modern, accessible, and intuitive web-based interface for managing their media downloads. While a robust CLI/TUI is available, the product's focus is on bridging the gap between high-performance downloading and a user-friendly web experience.

## Primary Goals
- **Performance at the Forefront:** Ensure that the tool's core strength—high-speed, parallel downloading—is the central pillar of the user experience.
- **Accessible Power:** Make complex download management (like parallel jobs and batch processing) simple and intuitive through the web interface.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Progress Dashboard:** A central hub to monitor multiple active downloads, showing real-time speeds and estimated completion times.
- **Batch Queue Management:** Streamlined tools to add and prioritize large numbers of URLs or entire playlists with minimal user friction.
- **Persistent Media Library:** A comprehensive view for managing and organizing completed downloads, enriched with high-quality metadata and thumbnails.
- **Integrated Media Player:** A built-in, seamless playback experience that allows users to enjoy their downloaded content directly within the browser, serving as the product's signature "killer feature."

## Visual Aesthetic & UX
- **Media-First Design:** A visually rich interface that prioritizes imagery, thumbnails, and album art.
- **Modern Media Experience:** The UX should feel more like a high-end media player than a utility tool, emphasizing ease of navigation and a polished look and feel.
